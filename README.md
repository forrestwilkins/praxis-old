# Praxis

Praxis is an open source social networking site. Motions are the main focus and come with a wide variety of voting features, with consensus as the default. Create a group and set it to no-admin, allowing group members to create motions and democratically decide on name, settings, roles, or planning of real world events.

While model of consensus is the default, group members will also be able to use regular majority vote, and have the ability to create and assign new roles with various permissions. All of this can be tailored in group settings to meet the specific needs of your community, either by a groups admin, or by motions as a group evolves over time.

The tech stack includes the following:

- Apollo GraphQL
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Prisma

Praxis is free and open source software, as specified by the GNU General Public License.
